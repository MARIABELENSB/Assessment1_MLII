# Estimating Hourly Utilization from Available Variables

## Objective
The objective of this project is to estimate the hourly utilizations of a day based on the available variables. This involves utilizing ensemble techniques and comparing them with more direct methods. Additionally, a fair validation will be conducted to select the best approach among those attempted.
